Real-time Face Detection and Tracking

This project is an exploration into the fascinating world of computer vision, 
focusing on the real-time detection and tracking of human faces using modern machine learning techniques. 
The goal is to create a system that can identify and follow faces in live video streams, opening up possibilities for interactive applications, security systems, and creative experiments.

Why does this matter? In a world increasingly shaped by the intersection of technology and human experience, t
he ability to interpret visual information in real time is both a technical challenge and a creative opportunity. 
Building something like this is a chance to learn about image processing, neural networks, and the subtle art of making machines "see"—all while having a bit of fun along the way.

Whether you’re here to learn, contribute, or just poke around, welcome. The code is a work in progress, and so is the understanding behind it. Let’s see where curiosity and a bit of code can take us.
